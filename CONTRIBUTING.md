# Contributing

A couple of quick tips to ease the submission process.

 * You may use [Github](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool), [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/source/list),
 or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/) to submit a pull request.

 * Please reference the bug number from our [issue list](https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/issues/list) in any pull requests to help associate fixes with bugs.

 * If possible, add unit-tests for any bugs that you fix.

 * [Building](http://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/wiki/BuildApktool) via Gradle will automatically run unit-tests. The build will end if any test fails.

 * [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is our IDE of choice. It has built in debugger support along with Gradle integration.

 * For changes to smali/baksmali please see their [page](http://code.google.com/p/smali/) for more information.


## Code Styles
 * A rough guideline based on [AOSP Guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).
 * A tab counts as 4 spaces and we use 4 spaces.
 * Our right margin is 120 characters long.
